Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

<h2>What are Data Structure?</h2>
Data structure are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

<h2>Why Data Structure?</h2>

<li>All software deals with data. They do some operations based on given data. Before processing the data we have to organize data in a certain way that makes the process very efficient.</li>

<li>From software application performance point of view, the efficiency and the performance of software depends on :
    <b>how the data is stored , organized and grouped together during programming execution.</b></li>
    
<h2>What is an Algorithm?</h2>

Set of steps to accomplish a task

<h2>Algorithms in Computer Science</h2>

 set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task
 
<h2>What makes a good algorithm?</h2>
<li>correctness</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>

<h2> Types of Data Structure</h2>

<h2> Types of Algorithms</h2>
Algorithms can be classified based on the problem they are trying to solve.
<li><b>Simple recursive algorithms</b> </li>

    - Works in the same way as iterative algorithms, recursion acts as a loop.
<li><b> Divide and conquer algorithms</b></li>

    - Divide the problems into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively.
    
    - Combine the solutions of the subproblems into a solution to the original problem.
    
    - Examples:Quick sort and Merge sort
<li><b>Dynamic Programming algorithms</b></li>

    - They work based on memoization.(past result is stored to compare with new result.)
    
    - To find the best solution.
    
    - Usally used for optimization problems as goal is to find optimal solution.   
<li><b>Greedy algorithms</b></li>

    - We take the best we can without worrying about the future consequences.
    
    - We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution.
<li><b>Brute force algorithms</b></li>

    - It simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found.
<li><b>Randomized algorithms</b></li>

    - Use a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision.
